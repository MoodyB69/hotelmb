          <h2>The history of our hotel</h2>
          <p class="historyp">
            he precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe. For
            a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, coaching inns
            served as a place for lodging for coach travelers. Inns began to
            cater to wealthier clients in the mid-18th century.
          </p>
          <p class="historyp">
            A hotel is somewhere where one can sleep away from their home. This
            could be for a holiday or for business purposes, or for convenience
            when travelling for any other reason such as a hospital appointment
            in a different area. They are short-term lets ranging from one night
            to a few weeks.
          </p>
          <p class="historyp">
            In those days there were places where you could exchange money or
            goods for a roof over your head for the night. This was especially
            important at this time because journeys were taken by foot (or horse
            and cart, later), so getting places took much longer than it does
            now.
