              While you enjoy a cocktail by the swimming pool on the rooftop
              terrace, you will be stunned by the breathtaking view of the bay
              of Isola Bella. Here, during your summer stays, our bar serves
              traditional Sicilian dishes, snacks and salads.

                  The staff were all very friendly and helpful and no request
                  for assistance was a problem for them. The hotel is well
                  situated, being close to shopping, transport, and the tourist
                  sites. We would definitely stay there again.

                Lovely hotel and staff. Breakfast was enjoyable and had a good
                selection with attentive staff. Received good recommendations
                for food. Room was clean with the essentials. Hotel central,
                everything we needed for a short visit to Helsinki.
